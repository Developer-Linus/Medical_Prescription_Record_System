# Project Motivation
> Health is our greatest asset, and poor health can hold us back from reaching our full potential. Managing medications and prescriptions can be a daunting task, leading to missed doses, incorrect administration, and decreased quality of life. I believe a system that simplifies prescription management could be a game-changer. A digital platform that tracks medications, sends reminders, and provides personalized support could empower individuals to take control of their health. Our project aims to develop such a system, improving medication adherence, reducing errors, and enhancing overall well-being. By doing so, we can help people thrive and live life to the fullest.
